4.0,Sticky stair riser tread thingies are utterly useless.,"Tried to load photos, but none of my photos or videos ever want to load on amazon. Weird huh? Bought this as “like new” from amazon. It’s not. Whoever returned it got dog hair all over the sticky stair riser treads & they will not stick to the plastic stairs so neither of my service dogs will use them although it’s identical to the last stairs we owned.  Mine is garbage bc it was previously used.",[],B084SXF9Y8,B0BHTBS5RM,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,1675529329744,0,True
1.0,Dangerous bc metal not properly coated! Rough edges!,"Where to begin?  I’ve been trying to get the 20 pics of these eyesores to upload since I received them, but they won’t. I ordered them bc one of my service dogs had emergency surgery & both pups were exposed to weed killer my LL put down, but I was unaware of & both pups became ill.  I knew when they arrived that I should have immediately returned them bc both boxes had the look about them that they were someone else’s previous returns.  The bad tape jobs on the boxes are generally a pretty good indicator imo. Both kennels had been placed together in one larger box for shipping so they should neither of them have had such a horrific tape job applied to them. I’ve purchased Midwest kennels for over 35 years & I’ve never purchased them with this kind of tape job in my life.  These were not “factory sealed”.  These hasd obviously been opened & returned. Worse- it looked as tho someone kept the new kennel & returned their old one bc you can literally see where all the powder coating is missing on these kennels which happens over time from use & friction.  One piece in particular has no coating on it whatsoever as can be seen in the photos that won’t load. Lol.  I thought I was buying direct from the manufacturer this time as I’ve moved away from buying from third party sellers due to receiving items like these kennels.  What’s annoying is I desperately needed this for a dog post surgery & im left with an un-safe kennel.  The metal is jagged throughout. I’ve cut my own hands numerous times bc the costing is missing & the metal is bare & rough.  Either the quality of Midwest has taken a nosedive in the 4 yrs since I last purchased a kennel or someone sent me used items.  I cannot recommend this item bc it is dangerous to ur pups eyes, nose, skin, paws, fur, etc.  jagged edges have no business near animal nor human bodies.","[{'small_image_url':

Quality Control should have tried the bolt end and realized that one end will not open at all!  It’s infuriating as I was really looking forward to using this leash for the “hands free” walk!  These bolts suck. The price is great until you realize you either have to return the entire thing which I am planning to do or you have to find new bolts and take the leash apart and install the new ones. They have a stupid little twisted wire thingy like ink pens do. Useless.  My grandson loves the leash. The color is pretty and the lime green makes it easy to find in a house filled with 4 kids under 8 and kids toys and dog toys everywhere.  I literally bought it because we can never seem to find the other leashes before we risk an accident!  Said grandson likes to play with them/lose them/ hide them no matter how well you think you organized them the last time you put them up!  It’s sad that this really is a quality piece for a great price except for those stupid bolts!!! Argh!  The price of new bolts and the pain in the butt it will be to replace them means I may as well return it and hope I can find an exact duplicate to repurchase.

The other cat (let's call her Brat) lurks nearby and stares longingly at it, wishing she could join in, but alas is too haunted by the memory of what happened many years ago with a similar toy. She had grabbed the feather, managing to snatch the whole stick out of my hand, then panicked when the stick fell on the ground, got herself tangled in the toy & string, and made a mad dash through the house with the stick trailing behind her terrified, freaking-out self. She's never been able to join in on the fun since. So...moral of the story, just make sure you have a REAL firm grip on the dang stick and your cats (and you) will enjoy hours of entertainment.

5.0,Wonderful upgrade for my adult dog,"I bought this crate to give my adult dog an upgrade so that he would have lots of space but can be safely confined if he is sick, if he needs a nap asap, if maintance is coming while I am at work, etc. It's very well made and sturdy, and I love that both doors have 3 locks.

5.0,"As always, ruffwear delivers","In my experience ruffwear is always top of the line when it comes to dog products, and this pouch is no exception. I clipped a clicker to the clicker loop, added a few plastic bags to the outside pocket (clicker can still be tucked inside) and filled it with treats... I take it with me on every walk to reward good behavior such as loose leash walking, heeling, looking away from squirrels, etc and use it for clicker training sessions at home.<br /><br />The bag is contoured to fit against the curve of my hip and can be bent/adjusted. The small red tab on the outside and magnetic closure mean it can be operated with one hand. The bag closes securely. I love that the clip where it atatches to my pants is in the middle of the bag, not above it as with many other models. The bad is securely attached and does not wobble or sway. I don't use the included red belt, but it's very nice and will be useful with dresses, etc.",[],B079J22K9D,B079J22K9D,AGBFYI2DDIKXC5Y4FARTYDTQBMFQ,1650892503331,2,True
4.0,"Nice, well made bed but very thin","I bought this as a bed to go with my large dog's new crate. I like that the stitching is precise and it's a very attractive bed. My dog likes the plush raised sides. However the center part of the bed is very thin - about 1/2"" and does not provide a comfortable amount of padding. I put an additional clothes cell phone pad underneath the bed to make it more comfortable for him. This is a strange thing to overlook because the main point of the bed is that it should be comfortable for a pet to lay on while they're in the crate!

5.0,"In between sizes, got a large daypack for 27"" girth 50lb dog, he loves it","My dog has a 27"" girth and I was not sure if he needed a medium or a large, I got a size large. The straps are designed so that they can be tightened all the way, so it was easy to tighten them down to his size. We got it recently but it seems very durable and well made, I'll update if we have any problems. The pockets are large enough to hold 2 standard disposable water bottles (16.9 oz or 500 ml) per side or a single 750 mL reusable water bottle. Weight wise this is probably the max that my dog can carry (it would be about 5lbs or 10% of his body weight). The pockets do seem big and roomy though!<br /><br />I decided not to use the attachment ring on the harness because it destabilizes the load when my dog moves about. I clipped the leash to his collar instead. I think having a pack gives him a ""job"" and he walked very nicely with it on so this was not a problem. I would not recommend using this item for a dog who pulls strongly as it may slip around.",[],B000UTA1G4,B089B3KT43,AGBFYI2DDIKXC5Y4FARTYDTQBMFQ,1599165589718,0,True
5.0,"Great long leash for training, exploring, and play","Beautiful leash! A bit hard to manage at first but you get the hang of it. My dog loved having so much space to run and play. I took him to a big empty area to work on recall, play fetch, run and sniff, etc. You'll want to use one hand to hold excess line and one to keep the leash off the ground so your dog doesn't trip. You can also clip the end to your belt for security. I also recommend using a harness so your dog won't be putting pressure on his neck. We had a great time though and my hyper, high energy pooch wore himself out safely without the risks of letting him run off leash in a public place. The leash has beautiful bright colors and is very sturdy and well made.",[],B07XNXFKT7,B07217B2KF,AGBFYI2DDIKXC5Y4FARTYDTQBMFQ,1589548781145,0,True

5.0,Nice harness,"I just got this harness and it's already so much better than the ones we've tried on in person. My dog is a 55lb year old mix with a deep chest and narrow neck/shoulders and other harnesses didn't fit well. He measured for a medium and it fits well after we adjusted the harness (measure your dog!). The front clip discourages pulling and makes walks easy and fun. Back clip doesn't prevent pulling but my dog doesn't seem to know this and pulls less whenever the harness is on just in case it might pull him sideways. The loop on the top is useful to grab my dog as needed or while changing the leash attachment point. We've also used the car attachment a few times and he settles right down to lay down in the back seat.<br /><br />My dog loves the harness and gets excited when I bring it out, so I assume it's comfortable. Looks well made and durable. The reflective stitching is really bright. I think this is much more comfortable for my dog than waking with a collar and it's more comfortable for me because I don't have to manage a large dog who is pulling me around. He is much calmer and better behaved with this harness so I really enjoy our walks.",[],B0774T9XTJ,B0973ZP49X,AGBFYI2DDIKXC5Y4FARTYDTQBMFQ,1582076123231,1,True

5.0,Excellent for cats and dogs!!,"Amazing!! This fountain works very well, is very quiet, and easy to assemble and clean (Take apart and clean about every 3 weeks), is easy to top off (just pour into bottom basin slowly), and it also provides a decent amount of ambient light at night. What I didn’t realize is that this also keeps the water cool. The top waterfall portion is where my cat prefers to drink from and the bottom basin is the dogs territory.<br /> Cold, fresh, circulating water = seeing my cat drink more water then ever before (he doesn’t l like sitting/still water). You WILL NOT regret this purchase.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Kg381HRQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Kg381HRQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Kg381HRQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1V8G1TLNBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1V8G1TLNBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1V8G1TLNBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B10JGZYQRLS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B10JGZYQRLS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B10JGZYQRLS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08CB1PFH6,B08CB1Y42M,AFEIN7QWSQ6EFW45LKD7ZOCSMLGQ,1626752961395,0,True
4.0,Just OK,It’s Ok for what it is I guess. My 42lb puggle fits it but I wish I’d went a size up.
